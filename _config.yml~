  I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics in the Perelman School of Medicine
  at University of Pennsylvania, well trained in both frequentist
  and Bayesian theories of statistics. I am extremely 
  passionate about statistical computing. Everything from openMP, MPI, CUDA, 
  openCL, to Hadoop, Spark. Let's crunch some numbers!
